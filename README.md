## Requirements implemented

### Structure
- [x] Header with minor navigation (Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)
- [x] Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation (search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)
- [x] Main section contains the font cards
- [x] Font cards display the Font Name, the font creator, the sample text, and an add button
- [x] Footer section with developer information

### Style
- [x] Sample text in each card is displayed in the corresponding font
- [x] Buttons/links are evident (the cursor changes)
- [x] Overflow handling is partially done, doesn't work if a single word is too long (11 characters)

### Functionality
- [x] Text typed into the custom text box immediately changes the sample text displayed in each font card
- [x] The sample text returns to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input
- [x] Font size chooser has four sizes and immediately changes the sample text font size in each font card
- [x] Clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation makes the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (but it does not actually reload the page)

### Other
- [x] README.md implemented
- [x] No errors in the developer console

### Extras implemented
- [x] Include a back-to-top button that allows users to scroll to the top once the top of the page is out of view
- [x] Make your design fully responsive (small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)
- [x] Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
- [x] Implement the change display icon so you can flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards
